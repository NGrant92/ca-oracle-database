# ca-oracle-database
Work for my Database assignment which involved designing, constructing and scripting a database from scratch. Mine is based around 
storing information for the game Overwatch. Such information includes: Events, Teams, Players, Heroes, Maps, Hero/Player stats.

The Scripts written allow a variety of information to be displayed such as heroes belonging to a certain category, a leader board style
display showing the best players by rank, a player's overall win% with each hero and various event information.
